# microscopy-image-analysis
A load of libraries related to unsupervised clustering of microscopy images. Consists of:

ipynbs of production code:
1. bbbc021 IO 1 - Patch Extraction - extracts patches, of course.
2. bbbc021 IO 2 - Data Partitioning or Folding - from IO 1, transforms data into k-folds as necessary.
3. bbbc021 - DL- Sparse Encoding - for sparse encoding a whole series of dictionaries en masse.
4. bbbc021 - DL - Assessing Recon, Viz, Clustering - for visualizing and computing reconstructions, based on the sparse representations.
4. bbbc021 - DL - BOA - Bag-of-atoms modelling, and classification.
